<p dir="ltr">"Fearlessness means total security.&nbsp; Fear is a jolt from the past; it reminds us of the moment when we left a place of belonging and found ourselves in a place of vulnerability. The Bhagavad Gita says that fear is born of separation, implying that the original cause of fear was the loss of unity. Ultimately,&nbsp; that separation is not a fall from grace but a loss of who you really are. To be fearless feels, therefore, like yourself."</p><p dir="ltr">-Deepak Chopra "The Book of Secrets: Unlocking the Hidden Dimensions of your Life"</p><p dir="ltr">It is when we are most vulnerable that we are most beautiful.</p><p dir="ltr">To truly open yourself up, to experience life as it naturally occurs, to not force-</p><p dir="ltr">to be.</p><p dir="ltr">To just be.</p><p dir="ltr">Let your intuition guide you.</p><p dir="ltr">Fall together with the pieces of your life you never knew even existed.</p><p dir="ltr">Open your heart.
