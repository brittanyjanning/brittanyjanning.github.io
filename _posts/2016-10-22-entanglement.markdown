<p dir="ltr">"Good timber does not grow with ease; the stronger the wind, the stronger the trees."<br>-Chinese Proverb<br>......................................................................<br>Energy.<br>So fleeting. <br>Contagious. <br>Infectious.</p><p dir="ltr">Like waves, it ebbs and flows.</p><p dir="ltr">Everyday we make a decision which energy we let in. </p><p dir="ltr">Do we let ourselves become consumed by others? Letting go of ourselves and our love. Losing the most integral part of our humanity- free will. </p><p dir="ltr">Our empowerment.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes we come across someone that entangles that inner peace.</p><p dir="ltr">We try to find calm, we try to maintain peace, love and light in our soul.<br>Yet, as hard as we try, there is something much deeper at work.</p><p dir="ltr">We come to understand that not all people are open.</p><p dir="ltr">They have not yet found this freedom within. If they had once, it is long forgotten in the ego of hurt and pride.</p><p dir="ltr">Our free will no longer seems like a choice. It seems as if the chains have tightened and we are caught.</p><p dir="ltr">Darkness falls and we feel a sense of loss in ourselves. An emptiness that cannot be filled.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, the most beautiful truth breathes into us. It's as if we are breathing our first breath of pure air.</p><p dir="ltr">We remember who we are. We refuse to lie still and let our lives go stagnant and cold.</p><p dir="ltr">Fearlessness.<br>Worthiness. <br>Strength.<br>Integrity.<br>Love.</p><p dir="ltr">We are warriors. Fearless and strong we stand up.</p><p dir="ltr">I promise you. You are worthy of all things beautiful in this world. No one and nothing defines you but what shines inside. </p><p dir="ltr">Become what you always have been. </p><p dir="ltr"><u>Free</u></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-csuVB40OWEI/WHjzIVRmNjI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/MWCxRaR93g0/s1600/IMG_20150615_195602.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"> <img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-csuVB40OWEI/WHjzIVRmNjI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/MWCxRaR93g0/s640/IMG_20150615_195602.jpg"> </a> </div>
