##****Love.****

 "There is only one serious question. And that is: 'Who knows how to make love stay?'....Answer me that and I will ease your mind about the beginning and end of time. Answer me that and I will reveal to you the purpose of the moon."

Tom Robbins, Still Life with Woodpecker

Love.

It is defined as an intense feeling of deep affection.
A mere word.
An idea.
A concept.
A belief in everything true in this world.
The very thing we live for.

An idea that holds such power.
Such intimidation.
Such strength.

A sweet addiction.
A powerful antidote.

We ache for a love so passionate.
We yearn to tremble in its path.

Set our world on fire and leave us burning.

What happens when we find this love that we seek for.
It's not enough.
Never enough to quench our thirst.

We seek for its deeper meaning.
We yearn to hold onto it forever.
Fearing it's loss we become selfish, weary, jealous and stagnant.

How to make love stay.
To hold tight and refuse to let go.

This expectation leaves us gasping towards the thin surface of water above us-
Transparent.
Our reflection taunting us.

Gasping, pulling, pushing, trembling, below the surface,
fearing for our lives-
We pray for one sip of air to keep us alive.

How do we push above?

How do we breathe in this immense sensation and not fall back into selfish intentions.

Love is like air.
Fluid.
Always moving.
Never seen.

You cannot hold it.
You cannot catch it.
It never lies still.

Without love,
Without air,
We are nothing.

We grow stagnant and die.

Love never stays.
It never leaves.

It is here now.
Allowing this moment.
This presence.

It will remain this way.

Love is not hurt.
Ego is.

Allow love to come as it is.
